                <p class="message">This was silly. Git is something I use <span class="ed">every day</span>. I needed to learn it to make my development workflow smoother and more efficient.</p>
                <p class="message">Over the past five years Iâ€™ve spoken to conferences, given workshops, and trained teams to use Git effectively. I took all of that experience and put it into this video course to guide you from <span id="colored">git init</span> to <em>Git Master</em>.</p>
